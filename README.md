# DeepChess
In this project our team implemented a Deep Learning model able to intuitively evaluate chess positions.
Our goal for this project was to avoid any kind of prior knowledge and follow, as much as possible, an end-to-end learning approach. To do so, our model leverage both unsupervised and supervised training based on top level computer chess games. To test our model, we made it compete against a well known classical engine. 
Although its relative simplicity the model is able to achieve human level of play in a couple of hours of training.
